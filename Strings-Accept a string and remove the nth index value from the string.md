# Module-3
# ðŸ§¹ Strings-Print every single item between 2 to 10

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that accepts the string and prints every second item between 2 to 10.



## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Start the program.
2.Read a string from the user as input.
3.Extract a substring from index 2 to 9 (inclusive of 2, exclusive of 10) with a step of 2.
4.Store the sliced substring in variable a.
5.Display the message "The sliced string is 'a'" where a is the sliced substring.
6.End the program.

## ðŸ’» Program
~~~
def slice(string):
    a=string[2:10:2]
    print("The sliced string is '"+a+"'")
string= str(input())
